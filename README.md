Hello and Welcome to my Machine Learning Depository, its basically all the files that i create while learning ML.
It may contain many or all duplicates but i tried my best to edit then.
I wont to posting the Dataset for the programs but you can edit the program according to your need. I will give a brief info about all the python files i have created till now.
Datapreprocessing.py - Is just a template i basically use for most of my Linear and Non Linear Regression models. But you  can also use it for almost every type of data preprocessing.
